# PlaySync

Hello! On this GitHub we will be launching our PlaySync AI platform on March 12. Our platform will be accompanied by a token which is rewarded to players for using our platform and providing us with data on NPCs.

Getting Started with the platform:
Prerequisites:
Python 3.8+
Game engine (Unity, Unreal Engine, etc.)
AI libraries: TensorFlow, PyTorch, or similar
Installation
Clone the repository:
Install dependencies:
Set up API keys for NLP services (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face).
Integrate with Game Engines
Import the AI-NBT API into your game project.
Define NPC parameters, such as emotional state, decision logic, and behavior modules.
Use the token system to enable NPC responses based on player interactions.

Additional information is provided in the additional information PDF that is within this repository for those interested in learning more about our platform!
